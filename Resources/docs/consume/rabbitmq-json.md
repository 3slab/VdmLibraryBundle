# Source RabbitMQ json

This source can collect data from a RabbitMQ queue containing raw json (i.e. not a serialized enveloper like Messenger usuallly handles).
To use this transport, refer to this (doc)[https://github.com/3slab/VdmLibraryAmqpTransportBundle/blob/master/Resources/docs/consume/rabbitmq-json.md]
